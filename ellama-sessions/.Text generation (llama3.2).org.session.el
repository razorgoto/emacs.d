**Option 1: Short and Sweet**

\"Life is full of unexpected twists and turns. But it's how we respond to them that truly matters. Take the road less traveled, and watch your dreams unfold.\"

**Option 2: Inspirational**

\"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. Don't be afraid to take risks and chase your passions. The world needs people who are unafraid to dream big.\"

**Option 3: Funny**

\"Coffee is like a warm hug for your insides. It's the perfect way to wake up on a Monday morning, or any day, really.\"

**Option 4: Poetic**

\"The stars shine brightest in the dark of night. Sometimes it takes a little darkness to appreciate the beauty that's always there. Keep looking up, and you'll find your own sparkles in the universe.\"
