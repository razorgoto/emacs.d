** User:
can you help me with the sytax for curl on the commandline? How do I download a file?

** Ellama:
You can use ~curl~ to download files from the command line. Here's an example:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl -O http://example.com/file.txt
#+END_SRC

In this example:

- ~-O~ tells ~curl~ to save the response to a file on disk, rather than displaying it in the
  terminal.
- ~http://example.com/file.txt~ is the URL of the file you want to download.

If you want to specify a different filename, you can do so like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl -O -C - file.txt http://example.com/otherfile.txt
#+END_SRC

In this case, ~curl~ will overwrite the existing file ~file.txt~, and then add the contents of the
other file (~otherfile.txt~) to it.
